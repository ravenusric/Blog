This may be your feeling when it comes to working with people. It can be very challenging for sure. I was assigned a random group for the second group project of our bootcamp at UNCC Full Stack Bootcamp. We were put in groups of four.
Some were arranged in groups of five, and others groups of three. 

The first day was all about getting ideas together and voting on which idea we would go forth to conquer as a group. There were many wild ideas thrown about the room as every group was huddled all in the same class and sounding like an elementary cafeteria! If you are like me, you found it difficult not to listen to all the noise. I heard groups arguing back and forth over the ideas being pitched. I could have sworn this may be the beginning of the apocalypse! 

Our group came down to two ideas. A recipe app where people can trade recipes or an app that allows users to invest in stocks. Now I am going to say that I absolutely know nothing about stocks but the group voted and the stock app is what we went with so I decided to put my best foot forward.

When I think of stocks I imagine myself in the mail room starting out like Michael J Fox in "Bright Lights, Big City" or more so like Charlie from "It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia". I can see myself getting lost in all the mail and not having a clue as to where it all came from nor where it is going! 

Since I had no clue what is going on in stocks I wanted to work the front end of this project and I was tasked with the styling and layouts. I felt much more comfortable here since I could add a little sense of myself in this project and not be over my head. 

The group was actually a joy to work with and they knew a ton more about stocks than I did so it all worked out. I never complained about the group project ideas since in the real world you may not always like the project you are working on but it means something to someone so it is always best to try to see it from another perspective and go for it!
